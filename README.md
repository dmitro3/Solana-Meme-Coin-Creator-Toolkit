Option to burn the LP tokens.

TOKEN_ADDRESS="address_from_mint"
LP_PAIR="lp_pair_created"
```
## Distribute Tokens



Create any number of fresh wallets and distribute a % of tokens to each new wallet.

* This option will spread distribution throughout a specified number of wallets. These wallets can then be used as "wash trading" wallets to increase the volume on your pair.  This greatly increases the visibility of your token on sites such as birdeye and photon. 


```python
# Create New Wallets
How many wallets would you like to create? (Default=10):
>

Creating Wallets....

..Wallet1 Created! 
    PublicKEY=abc123
    PrivateKEY=abc123abc123
..Wallet2 Created!
    PublicKEY=abc123
    PrivateKEY=abc123abc123
```

## Post Launch Options


It is essential to monitor your token once launched. 

* Example is using a token named "DogToes" with ticker "TOES". 

```python
# Launch Options

'TOES Price = $0.000000566' 
Select an option:
1. View Wallets and Balances
2. Increase the Volume!
3. Pump the Price!
4. Add more SOL to wallets
5. Dump ALL WALLETS (or trade LP if not burned)
```
* View Wallets and Balances

```python
# Wallets

Choose a Wallet: 
>
1. Wallet1
   TOES_Balance=123674122.00
   SOL_Balance=.0100087
   USD_Value=321.45

2. Wallet2
   TOES_Balance=437755732.00
   SOL_Balance=.00917558
   USD_Value=1056.89

3. Wallet3
   TOES_Balance=247355107.00
   SOL_Balance=.01074112
   USD_Value=644.42

```

Once a wallet is selected, Wallet Options will display.
```python
# Wallet Options

# Dumping a wallet sells all of the tokens in that wallet! 
# These tokens will be converted to SOL and added to your main wallet balance.
# Dump wallets from smallest to largest for best results.
# Wallet will be removed from your wallet list.

Wallet2
   TOES_Balance=437755732.00
   SOL_Balance=.00917558
   USD_Value=1056.89

Choose an option: 
>
1. Dump a % of Wallet
2. Dump Wallet
3. Go Back
```
## Increase the Volume
Option 2 in post-launch options will send multiple small trades from your wallets to pump the amount of transactions on your token.  With the default settings, each wallet will sell ~0.1% - 0.3% of its tokens at random intervals. 

```python

```

## Pump the Price!

Option 3 in post-launch options will send 1 buy order from each of your wallets.  The default setting will buy your token with a random amount of SOL between 0.005 and 0.015.  This gives you volume and can give your price a boost if needed.  Increase these amounts for a bigger pump.
* BE SURE YOUR WALLETS HAVE ENOUGH SOL IF USING THIS OPTION

## Adding more SOL  to wallets
Will distribute a user defined amount of SOL from your main wallet into your token wallets.

## Main Wallet Options

```python
# Main Wallet Options

Select an Option:
>
1. Create a New Main Wallet
2. View Public Address and Check Balance
3. View Private Key
